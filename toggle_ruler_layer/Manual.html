<h1 id="toggle-ruler-layer">Toggle Ruler Layer</h1>
<p>Since the "Ruler" Assistant doesn't have gradations you can draw measuring marks on a separate layer and reposition it over your drawing. Switching back and forth to that layer and changing tools to Transform and back to what you were using is the sole purpose of this script.</p>
<p>The ruler layer should be named "Ruler".</p>
